## Notes

* OMERO-metrics - side discussion. 

Meeting started with a discussion of the latest QUAREP work,
particularly Julio's work towards OMERO-metrics, a OMERO based
platform to inject image data and process and then track metrics of
the imaging system, resolution, field flatness etc...

Julio utilized LinkML to get the OMERO data model into his code.

* Cockpit timers

The fixes to the timers within cockpit were then discussed, Hopefully
this is now a solved problem. It took many years (!) to track down the
issue, but now there are two timer types. Events based timers, and
wx.timer type timers but they should all be kept track of and
terminated by the relevant module on window delete.

* Cockpit joystick code. 

David asked about the cockpit joystick code and its issue with
Mac. This seems to have been fixed in wxPython and the code now
correctly senses if there is a joystick present on the Mac, returning
if there isn't.

Ian has a slight update that the xbox controller he tried worked but
was way too sensitive. He will introduce a config parameter and a
useful default so the system is usable out of the box.

* Scipy API issue

Ian had problems running cockpit as he had upgraded python and running
into scipy API issues. Turns out scipy has made some of the calls
private accessed via another route. David has since updated the code
to call the correct functions

* Logging in cockpit

We had extensive discussions about logging in cockpit. David and Julio
were unhappy wit the current prints going to stdout which is then
trapped by the logging window and sent to an arbitrary log.

   David is keen on removing the print approach and moving it to a
   proper Python logging objects. This might also help solve the issue
   with messages before or after the logging panels start.

   Julio is keen to try and add experiment specific log files. Ian has
   always been keen on this as a human readable log file can be
   invaluable. However there is also an argument to ensure that most
   of this data is captured into the image file metadata as well.
