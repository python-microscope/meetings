## Notes

* First time with Tom in the meeting so introductions from everyone.

* Thorlabs stage (python-microscope/microscope#141)

  David discussed the thorlabs stage dll updates which prevent the
  crashes.  New version fixes the problem but Thorlabs has not yet
  released it.

* Cockpit OpenGL invalid context error (cockpit#778)

  Julio has Linux installation problems.  David says #778 is
  duplicated of #739 and that Cockpit on Debian/Ubuntu does not work
  with wxPython-4.1.1 so Julio needs to install 4.1.0.  No available
  fix yet, issue is likely on wxWidgets.

* Tom has issues with mosaic (cockpit#787)

  Discussing and debugging the issue with Tom disappearing tiles in
  the mosaic, we found that what was happening was the rescaling.
  When zomming out, the tiles disappear.  These were the megatiles not
  being displayed.  Turns out that the problem was that the display
  scaling meant they were displayed as white tiles (same colour as the
  background).  Tom needs to find out why this is happening.

  There was also an OpenGL crash which David suggested could be
  related to MicronOxford/cockpit@c974d9a3ae441eca391acc337

  Graphics card is Nvidia Quadro P2200

  There are no issues in an older version of Cockpit.  Suggested that
  Tom bisects git history until he finds the commit that introduced
  the problem.

* automatic data processing after acquisition

  Julio wants to automate the file save, covert to ome-tif and then
  start a deconvolution process automatically allow online data
  processing.

  David suggests, outside cockpit, to monitor for new files events and
  trigger as script when a new file is added to the results directory.
  This might have issues because we open and write to the file during
  acquisition.  So maybe write file to temp place then move to the
  fonal directory to trigger the file conversion and deconv.
  Alternatively, doing this from Cockpit, subclass the experiment and
  add extra stuff to the cleanup methods.

* Hardware recommendation (cockpit#783)

  Julio wants hardware recommendations to run Cockpit.  He reports
  issues saturating the 10Gb link when acquiring images with sCMOS at
  very high frame rates and plans to use ethernet bonding.  Ian
  suggested instead to use separate ethernet interfaces, one per
  camera.

  Hardware recommendation for Cockpit in general is very application
  and device specific so something we can't do general.  Suggested
  that we write on documentation tips and tricks (such as one camera
  per ethernet port) for the different cases.
