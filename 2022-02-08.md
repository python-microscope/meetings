## Notes

* fix on mosaic with deleting textures (cockpit #788)

  Cockpit #788 (PR) which closes Cockpit #787 has been merged but that
  reverts the Linux fix for cockpit #684 (part fix since that issue
  seems to actually be two issues).  Need to check in Linux if issue
  returned.

  David will test it.

* Microscope support for picam is broken (python-microscope/microscope#167)

  David says he thinks the picam is broken as it was rebased from a
  very old microscope version.  Ian will test the pycam and fix if
  needed.  See also meeting notes from 2021-10-12 meeting and notes on
  python-microscope/microscope#167

* multi channel on one camera (cockpit#686)

  Danny is using the multi-channel on one camera, This ought to be
  merged.

* digital z stack (cockpit#729, cockpit#691)

  Julio asks about digital Z stack and implementing similar behaviours
  for XY moves in a multi-position experiment.  RedPitaya has wait
  states and some stages return a signal when reaching position but
  that would lead to non-uniform time interval.

* slow multi-site experiment

  Julio has long lag between images in multi-site experiment, 10-12s
  between sites.  Not sure why but believes that many operations here
  could be made async for speed.

* truncated files

  If an experiment fails, user ends up with truncated dv files.  The
  header is created ahead of time and then frames added to it.  If
  experiment is not finished there will be missing frames and file
  will be smaller.  Not all tools can handle it.  If experiment is not
  finished not sure what is the best approach since we're left in an
  unkown state and may be better to stop messing with the file than
  potentially make things worse.  A knowable user might be able to
  salvage some of the data.

  Decided not to be to clever about rewriting headers as we don't know
  where or how it failed.

* duplicate events during snap with multiple cameras (cockpit#784)

  Julio has issue with duplicate events during snap.  This crashes his
  executor with 2 cams and 2 lasers. This is not in the action table.

* ImSwitch

  Someone is working on adding python-microscope support for ImSwitch.
  They have started with lasers and got Toptica iBeam and Cobolt
  lasers to work.  This led to small fixes (see
  python-microscope/microscope#232, python-microscope/microscope#233,
  and python-microscope/microscope#234)

* Hamamatsu (python-microscope/microscope#38)

  David getting the Hamamatsu camera control on Linux but only has one
  camera to test.  Multiple cameras is tricky but no way to test.
  Julio might try the code on multiple cameras.

* new microscope release

  David to make new release, mainly because currently we're
  incompatible with the last pyserial release (see
  python-microscope/microscope#233 and pyserial/pyserial#634).

  David will wait for Ian to check the picam code (we don't want to
  release if we're pretty sure it doesn't actually work).

* Vortan VersaLase (python-microscope/microscope#230)

  Veronika working on VersaLase multi-laser engine.  Mostly done and
  in final stages of debugging.  Having problems with serial
  connection from computer to laser controller.

* AO-tools

  Danny and Matthew have made a lot of changes on AO tools, both on
  the backend AO device but also on the UI.

* Ian's old branches

  Ian to look at pycam on Microscope, and multi-channel single cam
  experiments, digital z stack for merging into the main branch of
  Cockpit.
