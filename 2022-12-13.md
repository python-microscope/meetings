# 2022/12/13 - Microscope development meeting

## Attendees

Attending:
- Ian Dobbie
- David Susano Pinto
- Julio Mateos-Langerak
- Danial Stoychev
- Veronika Pfannenstill

## Notes

* Both Ian and Julio have been busy and not done any work. 

* David brought up Veronika has run out of digital output signals from
  her Red Pitaya. She has a BNC breakout box with 8 outputs, but needs
  access to the other 8 GPIO lines. Danny offered to help her connect
  them, they will connect afterwards to arrange this.

* David has moved the microscope website (still at
  https://python-microscope.org/cite.html) but now hosted under Davids
  control. Source is at
  https://github.com/python-microscope/python-microscope.org and David
  can be prodded to build and update the live site. Changes can be
  built and tested locally using Sphinx and make.

* Julio has some updates for microscope and cockpit to enable pseudo
  global shuttering on sCMOS cameras. This triggers the camera in bulb
  mode and for exposures triggers the lasers, waits for the
  readouttime to allow the whole chip to be active and then stops the
  camera and laser exposure simultaneously.

* David chimed in that he and Veronika was having trouble with bulb mode. Veronika has a Photometrics Kinetix camera.

* It was decided to implement Black formatting for cockpit. This is
  already applied to the microscope source code. We will try and
  integrate Julio's current outstanding issues and then apply Black as
  a single commit across the whole of the cockpit source tree.

* Danny has a number of outstanding updates.

** Minor DM fixes for microscope that include the ability clear the
   queue and load a new pattern.

** Minor general fixes in cockpit, including defining camera ROI with
   the mouse in the camera window.

** Major changes in ao-tools, Danny will start pushing these changes
   to the ao-tools main branch in the new year.

* Ian suggested that we move ao-tools to utilise Black for formatting as well.

* David asked what exactly the camera cycle time referred to. Ian said
  this had been discussed at length previously and suggested that it
  should refer to the minimum time between camera
  triggers. Complicated by sCMOS camera can actually overlap exposures
  with the rolling shutter. This issue was previously discussed at
  https://github.com/MicronOxford/cockpit/issues/522


* Julio said his laser takes an appreciable delay in fall time of the
  laser. Ian commented that there is already a timing variable that
  should be applied to all digital trigger devices you just need to
  define it and it will add a delay with that particular device. Ian
  will raise an issue on cockpit github.

* Ian mentioned running the Pi Pico as a timing device. Julio says he
  has a demo implementation reading an actiontable and flashing the
  Pico LED. There is already a cockpit issue for this.
