# 2022/12/13 - Microscope development meeting

## Attendees

Attending:

- Ian Dobbie
- David Miguel Susano Pinto
- Julio Mateos-Langerak
- Danail Stoychev
- Veronika Pfannenstill

## Notes

* Both Ian and Julio have been busy and not done any work.

* David brought up Veronika has run out of digital output signals from
  her Red Pitaya. She has a BNC breakout box with 8 outputs, but needs
  access to the other 8 GPIO lines. Danny offered to help her connect
  them, they will connect afterwards to arrange this.

* It was discussed that filterwheels hardware triggering do not work
  with the TriggerTargetMixin which expect triggers to come from a
  single line.  It is common to use multiple lines to set a positiion
  number and an additional line to trigger the move.  This is the
  state in the Cairn OptoSpin.

* The Microscope website at https://python-microscope.org/ no longer
  redirects to the version at Micron.  The source is
  https://github.com/python-microscope/python-microscope.org and the
  site is built and hosted by netlify.  David is using his own
  personal account which has a limit on CPU time spent on building the
  website.  While it is possible to have netlify automatically rebuild
  the website with each commit, because there is a monthly limit on
  CPU time spent on building the website, David will trigger it
  manually.  Changes can be built and tested locally using Sphinx and
  make.

* Cockpit does install on Python 3.11 because of wx (cockpit#834)

  The current version of wxPython does not install on Python 3.11.
  Because of that, Cockpit fails to install as well.

* Need new microscope release (cockpit#835)

  Development version of Cockpit fails to install because it is
  dependent on the current development version of Microscope.  While
  it is probably time to make a release of Microscope, this is not an
  issue when installing the last release of Cockpit.  It means we need
  to make a new release of Microscope before a new release of Cockpit.

* Julio has some updates for microscope and cockpit to enable pseudo
  global shuttering on sCMOS cameras. This triggers the camera in bulb
  mode and for exposures triggers the lasers, waits for the
  readouttime to allow the whole chip to be active and then stops the
  camera and laser exposure simultaneously.

* David chimed in that he and Veronika was having trouble with bulb
  mode. Veronika has a Photometrics Kinetix camera.

* Code style in cockpit (cockpit#649)

  It was decided to implement in cockpit the same formatting style as
  python-microscope (black and isort). This is already applied to the
  microscope source code. We will try and integrate Julio's current
  outstanding issues and then apply Black as a single commit across
  the whole of the cockpit source tree.

* git pre-commit hooks to keep style in Microscope

  David and Julio have been using git pre-commit hooks to keep the
  style of the project.  Julio has the hook running black
  automatically while David has it rejecting the commit unless it
  passes the black style check.  David's option is because he often
  only commits part of the changes in a file.

  It was also discussed we could use Github Actions to run it on pull
  requests but we do not use Pull Requests and we do not want to have
  a bunch of extra commits that just change the style.  There's not
  that many of us, so we will just tell/require that contributors just
  use something to ensure the style.

* Danny has a number of outstanding updates.  He expects to be able to
  spend more time on merging them in the coming months.

** Minor DM fixes for microscope that include the ability clear the
   queue and load a new pattern.

** Minor general fixes in cockpit, including defining camera ROI with
   the mouse in the camera window.

** Major changes in ao-tools, Danny will start pushing these changes
   to the ao-tools main branch in the new year.

* Ian suggested that we move ao-tools to the same code style as
  Microscope and Cockpit.

* David asked what exactly the camera cycle time referred to. Ian said
  this had been discussed at length previously and suggested that it
  should refer to the minimum time between camera
  triggers. Complicated by sCMOS camera can actually overlap exposures
  with the rolling shutter. This issue was previously discussed at
  https://github.com/MicronOxford/cockpit/issues/522

* Julio said his laser takes an appreciable delay in fall time of the
  laser. Ian commented that there is already a timing variable that
  should be applied to all digital trigger devices you just need to
  define it and it will add a delay with that particular device. Ian
  will raise an issue on cockpit github.

* Ian mentioned running the Pi Pico as a timing device. Julio says he
  has a demo implementation reading an actiontable and flashing the
  Pico LED. There is already a cockpit issue for this.
