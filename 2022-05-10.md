# Notes

- Started with a quick chat with Jun Sheng about his plans to recruit
  engineering focused students in the autumn to work on building an
  acusto optical point scanning imaging system

- Veronika has finished the add support for Vortan Stradus
  Versa-Laser. The code is sitting in an issue and David says he will
  review the code.

- Veronika has some problems with the Red Pitaya dsp replacement. it
  was working at some point but now doesn't seem to. There is some
  question of exactly what is on the SD card image. Ian has a version
  with DHCP so requires a DHCP server, probably on the main control
  PC. Ian will write summary of how to connect up rep Pitaya as a dsp.

- Veronika needs to match up BNC outputs on a 3d printed box. Ian
  suggest just connecting a light source and then using the dsp debug
  window to toggle individual lines until you find what line it is
  connected to. Danny suggested just using an oscilloscope, probably a
  better idea.

- Julio asked about getting labviw VIs into github, Ian said there was
  a NI provided diff tool for VIs with a suggested configuration to
  allow git to work with them. Alternatively the data could just be
  uploaded as a binary blob.

- Ian asked about the best way to implement homing and range finding
  on the Ludl stage driver in microscope. The stage has no idea how
  large its active area is an needs to be driven to a stop to get
  absolute positioning working. Suggestion is to not do it in the
  hardware init triggered by starting the device server, but later
  when the device server is connected to. This will allow a GUI to
  query if it is safe to move the stage.

- David mentioned that there was a post from Jacopo on image.sc about
  the best way to implement free running on the general camera
  API. There was some question over the best trigger.mode and
  trigger.type to use. The names of the types and modes are arbitrary
  and copied from the pvcam driver modes. David will respond to the
  image.sc post.
