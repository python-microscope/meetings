## Notes

* additional metadata to cockpit images (microscope-cockpit/cockpit#676)

  Ian has spent some time working on microscope-cockpit/cockpit#676
  and microscope-cockpit/cockpit#391 which add extra metadata to
  images saved from snap and mosaic.  Tom says that this will be quite
  useful since at the moment metadata for mosaic images are saved on a
  text file but often get lost when files are moved around.  Tom and
  David to review and comment.

  This only affects images from snap and mosaic.  Images for
  experiments get their metadata collected at the beginning of the
  experiment.  One thing discussed was that the timestamps used in
  experiments files are computed as difference from the first image.
  But we are not sure if this is per camera.  What happens when
  cameras are in different computers?

* DeepSIM code

  A draft if the DeepSIM paper is ready.  The code used in DeepSIM are
  specific branches in Danny's fork.  Ideally these changes would have
  been developed with us but that didn't happen.  It is not clear what
  some of the changes do, many seem specific to DeepSIM and would not
  work on other systems, and there's just too many of them to review.

  * Python-Microscope fork

    Code is at https://github.com/dstoychev/microscope/tree/deepsim/.
    There's effectively two changes: a fix for the case when pattern
    131 on Alpao is skipped (python-microscope/vendor-issues#12) and a
    new Alpao specific `flush_patterns` method.  David will try to get
    his hands on an Alpao mirror to test this but the `flush_patterns`
    should have gone into the ABC

  * Microscope-Cockpit fork

    Code is at https://github.com/dstoychev/cockpit/tree/deepsim/.
    Ian took a look a quick it and reckons that many changes are
    DeepSIM specific and can't be merged.  Also, some changes seem to
    be incompatible and there's just too many merge conflicts.  No one
    is willing to do the work to merge this.

  * Microscope-AOtools

    Code is at
    https://github.com/dstoychev/microscope-aotools/tree/deepsim-matthew-danny/.
    Nick had a look and reckons most changes are at the UI level.
    Still, there are a lot of changes and we're leaving it to Nick to
    decide what to do.  However, at least some of the changes here are
    dependent on the changes in Python-Microscope so there's no point
    in accepting these as-is without accepting changes on
    Python-Microscope too.  It is quite possible that these changes
    are also dependent on the changes to Microscope-Cockpit.

* Digital Z stack experiment (microscope-cockpit/cockpit#792)

  This was never merged but Ian really though it was.  Implementation
  is described in microscope-cockpit/cockpit#792 and the need is
  described in microscope-cockpit/cockpit#691.  David will try to take
  a look.

* `zoom()` in `PiCamera` (python-microscope/microscope#285)

  Ian implemented this because he thought it would be faster than
  dropping the extra region in Microscope.  It wasn't any faster.  He
  left the code in case it was useful but it is not because it isn't
  any faster.  It is also a device specific method, not part of the
  ABC.  This method will be removed.

* setting camera trigger type (microscope-cockpit/cockpit#816)

  The settings dict is meant to provide a lower level list of device
  properties from the device vendor.  Originally, we exposed anything
  we though that could be useful there such as trigger types but we
  don't do that anymore.  Cockpit does not have an interface to select
  ROI and trigger type and binning, it previously used the settings
  dict.  As they get removed from the settings dict, we need a way to
  set them from Cockpit.  A possibility to add them without adding too
  much clutter is to make the settings dict window in cockpit have two
  parts, the top is the Microscope/Cockpit unified properties, and the
  bottom is the low level settings.

* Saving data as Zarr (microscope-cockpit/cockpit#881)

  This has been discussed a few times.  The main alternative before
  was OME-TIFF but the new format in town seems to be OME-Zarr.  At
  least this has a native Python interface that could make it easier.
  Ian will try to save snap images as a test.

  At the end, the main reason we continue stuck with dv format is that
  we mainly used this for SIM experiments and the best SIm
  reconstruction is in SoftWoRx.
