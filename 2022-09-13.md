## Notes

* Cockpit experiments fail with connection error

  Veronika and David have an issue in Cockpit where experiments end
  with a Pyro4 error.  Ian suggested that the problem is that the
  cockpit server has not been setup correctly and never gets the reply
  from the RedPitaya that the experiment has finished.

  David suggests that checking for correctly setting the client should
  be done at start of cockpit to prevent this issues.  David will open
  an issue about it.

* Non-int sizes in Cockpit wx code.

  Nick has been having issues with this.  Ian recently pushed a change
  to the touchscreen to fix exactly this issue, may be present
  elsewhere.  Nick will check again and open an issue about it if the
  issue remains.

* Cockpit memory leak on MacOS fixed (cockpit#815)

  Ian has had this problem for a while.  Has recently upgrade wx and
  the problem seems to be gone.

* Adding generic digital IO device to Microscope (python-microscope/microscope#251)

  Julio and Ian want a simple device that just flips mirrors.  This is
  just about setting a bit on some register.  David things that it's
  not any different from the executor class and should instead
  implement an ABC for the executor in Microscope.  There will be
  extra logic required in Cockpit and how it affects the light path.

* Cockpit assumes that executor starts with all lines in low

  David and Veronika found that when Cockpit starts assumes that all
  digital lines start low.  This can be seen on the executor debug
  window.  If one exits Cockpit leaving a line high and starts it
  again, the line remains high (for example, laser might still be
  emitting light) but the debug window will show it low.

  David will open an issue about it.

* Light sources with a third state beyond enable

  Danny has been working with new light sources and they don't work
  well with the API of microscope.  The reason is that both TTL signal
  and software control whether light is being emitted.  He needs a
  third state where the device is on and enabled (enable does nothing)
  but is not emitting light to work with Cockpit.  He has something
  working for him with a new `set_state` method.

  David thinks that the issue is not on the Microscope API it's on
  Cockpit interface.  There is an indirect third state on Microscope
  which is via the `set_trigger` method to control all of these cases
  but Cockpit does not make use of it.  Hence the need to have
  `enable` doing nothing.  But this is a Cockpit issue and it's the
  Cockpit interface or backend that should be adjusted.  Danny agreed
  that if Cockpit interface adjusts then Microsocope wouldn't need
  change.

  The possible combinations of trigger types and modes is not clear
  but David made a table on another issue recently.  David will put
  that table on the documentation.

* PVCam software trigger missing

  Danny found an issue where sending software trigger are missed if
  sent before the camera is ready.  He has a fix and will open an
  issue about it to be merged.

* Cockpit experiments with software triggers only

  Danny is building a system where many devices do not take hardware
  triggers.  He's been working on making Cockpit experiments that do
  not need an executor and only use software triggers.  Ian advised to
  at least use the camera as master device to control light source
  exposure.

* Linkam stage with Linux

  A group in Physics is interested in using the Linkam stage but they
  are doing it all in Linux.  David is helping them but no one has
  tried the Linkam SDK in Linux yet.  They're not sure they'll buy it
  yet.

* Thorlabs stage

  Julio has recently reported by email an issue controlling a Thorlabs
  stage.  Veronika had a problem before where it would sometimes crash
  during the LoadSettings.  It was fixed by an unreleased version but
  that was almost one year ago.  Veronika has not tested the official
  releases since so does not know if the fix is public.

* Vortan laser has issues changing settings when not enabled

  Veronika is finishing adding support for the Vortan laser.  However,
  there is the issue that one cannot set the laser power or trigger
  type without first enabling the laser and possibly emitting light at
  whatever was the last used laser power for some time.  Vendor says
  there is no fix and suggested fix of enabling external analog
  control.

* Prevent stages from moving to limits each time Cockpit starts

  Danny suggests that microscope stages need a separate home method
  that cockpit can call at start separate from enable.  David and Ian
  have recently made a slightly different change and instead added a
  method that reports whether enable is likely to trigger a move.  See
  cockpit#809 and python-microscope/microscope#246.

* DeepSIM stages have separate home methods

  The stages in DeepSIM have home methods that can be called manually.
  This was in discussed with the point above but its moot because
  neither is in Microscope, they're Cockpit devices only.

* Danny multiple branches

  Danny has been making a lot of changes but are in a state not yet
  ready to be merged.  He will polish them and open issues to get them
  merged.
