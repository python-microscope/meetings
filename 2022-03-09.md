# Notes

- Project mailing list.  Ian has requested John Hopkins to create a
  mailing list as he often forgets someone to include someone when
  emailing.  David mentioned that we already have a tag in image.sc
  and prefers to have a single place.  Julio prefers image.sc.  Others
  also prefer image.sc. It is possible to receive emails from it,
  follow specific tags with RSS, and most present already have an
  account on it.  It was agreed that we would use image.sc instead of
  the mailing list (but use github issues for more code issues and
  development).

- Jacopo and Francesco, PhD student and Post-doc in Christian Eggeling
  in Jena have been integrating Microscope into ImSwitch for an iSCAT
  setup.  They have a working proof of concept that needs to be
  solidified.

  Lasers are working but are not able to transfer some configuration
  parameters to laser from ImSwitch.

  They have started with adding cameras but hitting trouble with ROIs.
  They are using an industrial model from Ximea.  The width and height
  of the ROI are interdependent.  They probably need to be checked
  after change.  Jacopo will open an issue on Python Microscope to be
  followed so others can try on other Ximea cameras.

  Jacopo also wants to use freerun mode of the Ximea camera that is
  not currently supported.  David said it probably works if they
  access the internals directly.  Jacopo will on image.sc to discuss
  how.

  Jacopo also has a stage from MadCityLabs which they will try to add
  next.

- When adding support for more devices, David suggested not using
  python bindings but directly wrapping the vendor DLL's with ctypes
  as this often reduces bugs and implementation issues.

  What to interface DLLs with - Ctypes - CFFI - Swig.  Swig horrid.
  CFFI has advantge that uses real headers which might solve
  documentation issues, but requires distribution of headers which can
  lead to licensing problems.  So prefer ctypes as long as it's
  manageable.

- Tom reports things are working fine on his side.

- Ian reports much less crashing on exit after Tom changes.

- DLL load path in Windows since Python 3.8 has changed
  (python-microscope/microscope#235) and causes issues.

- Julio asked about SLM in Python-Microscope
  (python-microscope/microscope#67, python-microscope/microscope#136
  python-microscope/microscope#198, and
  python-microscope/microscope#199).  Ian says that SLM was the
  prototype for Microscope device server but never ported.  David
  suggests that we should implement minimal base device class for SLM
  based on it and that the SIM based functions should be a separate
  package.  This is the same approach with microscope-aotools where
  Microscope only provides a simple Deformable Mirror class.

- Danny reports issues with hardware triggers the Alpao deformable
  mirror.  The device triggeres on every change, rasing or falling.
  Additionally every 131 pattern is repeated.  They have a work around
  that trigger twice for these patterns getting the expected results.
  Not ideal but seems to work, as time is limited Danny was not going
  to raise the issue with Alpao.
