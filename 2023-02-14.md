## Notes

* Async Digital IO device (python-microscope/microscope#270 and
  MicronOxford/cockpit#846)

  Ian has pushed python-microscope/microscope@e790a49 and
  MicronOxford/cockpit#824 that adds a digital IO device and is making
  plans to change it to make use of DataClient.

* Add all settings to Ximea camera (python-microscope/microscope#262)

  Julio started adding support for all Ximea settings but found that
  it's Python API is very unreliable and it is difficult, maybe
  impossible, to find which settings each camera actually supports.
  Jacopo has some experience with Ximea cameras and will try.  David
  will review.

* incorrect use of WinDLL (python-microscope/microscope#261)

  Has discussed last year.  Danny has tested the proposal on the Alpao
  mirrors and it is fine.  We asked Tom to test on the Linkam stage
  but he hasn't replied.  Ian will email Tom again.  If he doesn't
  reply, we'll make the change anyway.

* no method to specify image bitdepth

  We have method in Microscope to specify what bitdepth should the
  images be acquired, user needs to go through the settings.  We also
  have no way to specify which is the bitdepth and the user needs to
  infer it from the image datatype.  But this does not work if the
  bitdepth is 14bit since the datatype is 16bit.  Ideally, when the
  image is returned it is returned with some metadata object that
  specifies things such as grayscale/RGB/BGR/whatever, bitdepth, and
  possibly other stuff.  Cockpit Also has a similar issue in that it
  only saves images (MicronOxford/cockpit#345).

* Progress in ImSwitch

  Jacopo has been working in adding support of Microscope cameras to
  ImSwitch has had some success.  He will try other devices later.
  He's not sure how it will integrate controllers yet.

* Microscope documentation missing

  It appears that some of the documentation has disappeared from the
  website.  This seems to have happened when migrated to Netlify and
  may be due to sphinx versions.  David to investigate.

* Documentation for trigger type and mode

  What each trigger type and mode does is the most tricky part to
  understand, particularly because the same type/mode name means
  different things in different cameras.  There is a table that
  explains it in one of the issues but would be nice to add it to the
  actual documentation in the website.  David to look into this.

* Simulated camera with trigger type software and mode strobe

  The simulated camera only implements the type/mode software/once.
  Should be simple and useful (for Jacopo) if we also implement
  software/strobe.

* Need new Microscope release (and Cockpit)

  It's past time we make a new release of Microscope.  David will do
  one this month.  Ian says that a new Cockpit release is also needed
  since the current released version of Cockpit is not compatible with
  the current development of Microscope.

* No access to Cockpit documentation site

  Currently, Cockpit documentation is hosted in the Micron website
  which none of us has access anymore.  We should get a new domain
  that we control and host it somewhere.  Proposal is to host it in
  Netlify, same as Microscope.

* pco cameras (python-microscope/microscope#118)

  Mike Strauss and Pavitra SR need support for pco cameras.  David has
  heard good things about the SDK and the support that company does.
  The rep in Europe offered a demo camera to David a while back but
  David does not have time to do it anymore.  Joris Ah-Kane and his
  team will be doing it.
