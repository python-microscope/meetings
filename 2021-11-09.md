## Notes

* Cockpit paper

  Ian has started a document for the reviewers reponse.

* Cockpit file format documentation

  This is also something for the cockpit paper reviewers.  Ian copied
  the table describing the dv extended header and started a new page
  on the documentation with it.  The mrc format is properly documented
  and there's even a 2014 publication with the format but details of
  what we use come from Priism which is no longer online for 2 years.
  It is still available on web archive at
  https://web.archive.org/web/20180729122712/http://www.msg.ucsf.edu/IVE/IVE4_HTML/IM_ref2.html#ImageFormat
  and

* Vortan VersaLase

  David has started working on this with Veronika
  (python-microscope/microscope#230)

* Cockpit mosaic realignment

  Danail could not attend in person but confirmed by email "Ian was
  right and the stage is accurate enough not to need any realignment
  routines.  Just by making minor changes to the PhysikInstrumenteM687
  device, mainly in the `sendXYPositionUpdates()` method, the stage
  now properly waits to complete its motion before issuing another
  move command.  No missing tiles and all of them are at the right
  position, and the switching between objects seems to work well
  (subject to more testing)! I am doing some final tests this week and
  if everything works fine I will put it on GitHub and raise an issue
  on cockpit."

* public meeting notes

  David has created a repo for it and meeting notes are now public.

* Microscope website

  David has started to change the website to deploy automatically via
  netlify.  Once that is finished he will add the governance model
  pages.
