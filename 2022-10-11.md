## Notes

* ASI offer to add support for their stages (python-microscope/microscope#96)

  ASI commented out the issue about their stages saying they're open
  to do it themselves.  Ian asked more details but we haven't heard
  from then yet.  Ian will email them.

  Julio offered to test it.  Not sure if this will be a stage or a
  controler yet.

* General Digital IO device in Microscope

  Ian has implemented something similar to the piDIO and is reviewing
  it to be merged as ABC in Microscope.

  Also need some sort of sensor that keeps a log of measurements.

* Dany issues with having two clients for a camera.

  Not exactly clear what the situation is but seems that Danny may
  need to have two clients on the camera.  The use case is getting the
  image sent to Cockpit for display while at the same time is sent
  somewhere else for processing which then controls the DM.  Cameras
  in Microscope only send images to one client at a time (it uses a
  stack of clients and only the top client receives images).

* Ian been closing some old PR and issues.

  Would be nice if managed to clean up the backlog.

* Cairn filterwheel

  David is planning on adding support for Cairn filterwheels but that
  uses low level USB and David plans on using the pyUSB package for
  that.  That will be a new dependency but David will make it as
  optional since it's only for that device.  This is same as hidapi
  package which is only used by the Aurox device.

* New microscope release and website.

  We need to make a new release of Microscope but we no longer have
  access to the Micron website and neither do any of the people in the
  facility (they don't know how, the department IT won't do it, and
  they'd have to ask Douglas who charges Â£100).

  The hosting is all in place using Netlify but we're just redirecting
  to the Micron website.  David needs to sort out the build with
  netlify but the problem is how the website but maney of the
  documentation and other parts of the site are in the python package
  repo itself.

* Rollingshutter mode in cameras

  Julio needs to know the camera mode to control the lasers.  This is
  python-microscope/microscope#143 and cockpit#610.  Julio will read
  on those issues and we'll come back to this then.

* Cockpit multisite experiment is too slow

  Julio found that one of the slows is because between sites, Cockpit
  would reset the cameras.  If each site is quick, then that reset
  steps dominates the experiment time but the resetting can be removed.

  The root of the problem is that multi-site experiments are actually
  many experiments with a stage move in between.  The reset, as well
  as many other things done are what Cockpit does before and after an
  experiment.  David suggests that there shouldn't be a split between
  single-site and multi-site experiment and the experiment stuff
  should all be rethought but he tried to do it before and it is too
  much work.  We will probably just add another hack to it.
