# 2022/04/12 - Microscope development meeting

## Attendees

Attending:

- Ian Dobbie
- Julio Mateos-Langerak
- Thomas Fish


# Notes

- Software updates:

* Ian has polished the microscope picam code adding some camera
  specific functionality.

* Ian has added some documentation in cockpit for device specific
  config. Not complete yet but much better than the complete lack of
  documentation that existed before

* Ian has started implementing a Ludl controller. So far only
  supporting the stage and has substantial speed issues but is a work
  in progress. The controller can also support filter wheels, shutters
  and some basic digital and analog IO with the relevant
  modules. Ian's controller is very old but apparently the control set
  is still compatible. He has a newer Ludl controller as well in use
  that could be tested against.

- Tom has several fixes in cockpit that need to be merged. Ian will
  look at them, although the most complex is about the python 3.8
  windll loading issue. Tom has a suggested fix that we should check
  on other system before pulling.

- Julio has been devoting significant effort to SLM calibration,
  including moving the magic modulation parameter out of the code
  into a config option.

- The calibration process of he SLM and polarisation rotator was discussed.

* How far out to push the diffraction beams, via the diffraction angle
  SLM parameter. Ian says that CryoSIM uses about 80% maximum to
  increase contrast in the collected data due to the effect of the
  modulation transfer function of the objective dropping dramatically
  at the edges of the back pupil.

* Julio also had issues with the SLM images at very short camera
  exposures. The SLM has True Frame parameter which flips the control
  voltages every N frames to prevent charging and consequent damage to
  the SLM. He solved this by using more ND filters and longer
  exposures on the camera directly observing the SLM diffraction
  spots.

* Ian Showed a powerpoint from Chris optomising the SLM modulation on
  the Oxford CryoSIM setup. He sent a pdf of this to Julio and will
  upload the original somewhere but it is large (90MB).
