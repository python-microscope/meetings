Freetype segfaults
------------------

David found the Freetype issue was actually a problem in the upstream
package. This has now been fixed in the upstream development code. Ian
has tested the development branch on Mac and it removes the crash.

Other segfaults
---------------

In tracing errors on shutdown Julio and David have found that __del__
methods can happen at different times in the shutdown which leads to
problems in finding and preventing these segfaults.

The device Watchers are a problem on shutdown, They have an addWatcher
function but no stop or delete function.

Surprisingly, Python sets all objects to Null before deletion, which
contributes to the issues above as the null objects are then accessed
by the timers generating the segfaults.

Linkam stage
------------

The Linkam stage does not work on Linux. At least part of the problem
is the interface between the c based complex data types and the ctypes
code used to access them from Python.


Rehosting documentation
-----------------------

The cockpit documentation have been moved from the micron website to
https://microscope-cockpit.org/ and the pypi account has been moved
from micron oxford as well.
