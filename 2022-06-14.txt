# 2022/06/14 - Microscope development meeting

## Attendees

Attending:

- Ian Dobbie
- Veronika Pfannenstill 
- David Pinto
- Tom Fish
- Jacopo Abramo

# Notes

- started with a chat about some updates that Ian has done, including
  the new trails view - Cant be turned on or off through doesn't work
  properly in mosaic


- Tom's issue:- Switch between lasers and the 561 shutter starts to
  alarm with a loud alarm beep. Definitely an SR 470 issue as the
  laser and the shutter don't fully talk to each other. Tom thinks its
  a thread issue with the cockpit control device module.

- Jacopo asks if we know about the CZI grant for python-microscope
  integration into ImSwitch and UC2. Ian and David both talked to
  Xavier about and Ian wrote a letter of support for the grant. 

- JA also interested in trying to integrate ImSwitch and
  Python-microscope into Napari.

- David has some proof of concept code at
  https://github.com/carandraug/napari-microscope A thin wrapper to
  integrate the basic microscopes GUI controls into Napari.

- Jacopo says Napari has a new plugin architecture.

- JA asks about free running on the Ximea camera. He will add a link
  to his branch to the relevant issue on GitHub

- JA wants to get real cycle times from the camera. The Ximea camera
  dll returns both an image and a time stamp.

- David suggests that the Ximea driver should reimplement the fetch_loop
  method to return the dll provided time stamp.

- Jacopo wants to add interactive actions to microscope. Add flatfield
  correction to ImSwitch.

- Ian suggested using a microscope controller object to connect both a
  light source and a camera.

- Ximea API allows upload of a correction file to the camera FPGA to get
  effective hardware flat field correction. Ian says this should be
  added as a Ximea specific option through the settings interface. 

- JA release updated cockpit and microscope, we should!

- Veronika: hardware triggers. Wanted advise about digital versus
  analogue triggers for laser triggers.

- Ian said that analog triggers are not implemented for light sources
  in cockpit so advises digital. However do take care as the low input
  impedance of the laser triggers can mean they draw too much current
  to be directly triggered by the Red Pitaya, may need a level shifter
  and the ability to push more power. The DeepSIM and CryoSIM setups
  use pullup resistors to drive more power through the output signals.

- Tom: DLL on windows fix for microscope that is still in the issues.
