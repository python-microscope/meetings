To Discus,

Light exposure mappin gin experiment window

linkam stage dll loading

config sharing in microscope


How to access the exposure times as they are not easily exposed within

If laser not used in exposure list then put up warning to say the user has to set the config.

Parse grid to list cameras and light sources.

Ian will work on it.



Shared config: default config is shared if empty at init, so need a deepcopy

I will pulll this change.

Update masetr to b24 running branch, check with Tom maybe?


Microscope ignoring spurios output from serial devs, also including IO lock on serial devs.... All in discussion with Tom.
