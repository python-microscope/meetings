# 2022/11/08 - Microscope development meeting

## Attendees

Attending:
- Ian Dobbie
- Julio Mateos-Langerak

Apologies:
- David Susano Pinto
- Nick Hall
- Danial Stoychev

## Notes

* Both Ian and Julio have been busy and not done any work. 

* Julio was looking again at the triggering modes, cockpit issue #610
  global versus local shutter issues.

* Julio has designed and built a light source for transmission and
  lighting sample stage area. Based on neo pixels and plans to control
  it with an Arduino compatible controller. The 3d printed enclose is
  very neat and he will send Ian the STLs/design files.

* He plans to add microscope in center of the ring, allowing sample
  overview to be viewed. Optical component is at:

* We discussed using the Raspberry Pi Pico as an executor (sometimes
  misnamed as as DSP) for controlling experiments. Julio has a sparkfun
  RP2040 one with more memory then the Raspberry pi version.

** Julio will raise an issue regarding executor on a pico using the
   programmable IO modules for digital only IO.


* Ian mentioned hardware triggering issues with the picam module. They
  may be due to the trigger pulse being too short for the way the pi
  does HW triggers using GPIO pins. Julio suggested that the pulse
  length be a configurable parameter. Ian will raise and issue and see
  how hard this is to implement.

* Ximea camera accepts hardware triggers in the range 5-24v. In oxford
  they had an optical isolator also doing level shifting to convert the
  3.3V from the red Pitaya or Raspberry Pi to the required voltage.  Ian
  also advises to buy a prebuilt trigger cable as building hem is a
  pain.

* Julio mentioned doing some microscope demos and that he used
  gattaquant slide samples. These are similar to the molecular probes
  slides with multi-colour labeling of tissue culture cells but have
  real 3D structures.
