Note
----

Unfortunately this document was written up 2 months after the fact
from sparse written notes. Sorry for any omissions


Edit Readme to reflect new documentation - presumably the online
documentation moving from the micro website.

OnExit events
-------------

Julio is having problems with his FPGA on exit. On exit he finds
no-zero exit codes on close of the main window when run under
pycharm. He seems to have managed to fix it with code in the
__Delete__ function of the connection object of the FPGA.

Executor
--------

There seem to be problems with the Red Pitaya running out of space for
the action table. This appears to produce timeouts.

I have a note about "Analogue values in Action table Red Pitaya -1"?
no idea what it means.
